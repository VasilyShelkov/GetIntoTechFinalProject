From start to finish this (just over two hour movie)amazing movie keeps its audience entertained with non stop laughs, tears and overall enjoyment.\r\n\r\nI must admit that since \"I am Sam\" I have never left a movie feeling as happy as I did with Love Actually. It has a good, positive feeling about it which really is the centre of this masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe storylines sound confusing but really they are simple to follow and comprehend. 8 different love stories that interwine and end on an amazing climax on Christmas Eve. \r\n\r\nThe actors, the story, the scenery, the overall spectacle of this brilliant film have definately added it to my top 10 list alongside The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.\r\n\r\nFor a feel good, funny, dramatical masterpiece I strongly recommend it to anyone and everyone.'),
(2, 'She\'s like the wind', '2018-03-04', 2, 2, 'This movie has stood the test of time. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze make movie magic with the sultry dance moves. The choreography and the music make this a ride you will not want to get off of. Now considered a cult classic, it has spawned a television series, Broadway production and most recently a remake (that was horrific). Fantastic piece of celluloid history that ought to be revisited every now and again.'),
(3, 'Heartbreak Mountain!', '2018-02-05', 3, 3, 'For all of those who are holding back from watching this movie because it is \"gay\" or has love scenes between two men...oh! This movie has nothing to do with sex...and to be honest, I don\'t feel that it has much to do with homosexuality. This is the most beautiful and profoundly sad love story I have ever come across, and the fact that it is a love between two men is beside the point. It\'s about a love between two people who cannot be together, but if human beings were better at being human, and if the world was a better place, they would have lived out their lives side by side. I was so, so moved. AMAZING!!!! A must see.'),
(4, 'Pretty good movie', '2018-01-08', 4, 4, 'Wow! Richard Gere and Julia Roberts give magical performances as a shrewd businessman and a lovely prostitute. I was really moved by the blend of humor and romance. The romance was what really moved me. I thought that Edward (Richard Gere) and Vivian (Julia Roberts) looked good in the attire they wore to the opera in San Francisco. Oh, boy, if you ask me, Julia Roberts did, indeed, look like a pretty woman in this movie. PRETTY WOMAN really tugged at my heart and soul and made me laugh at times. Don\'t say I have a twisted sense of humor, but I laughed really hard when Edward yelled at Stuckey (Jason Alexander) to get out of his hotel room. If I ever travel to Beverly Hills, I\'m going to stay at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, that is, if I can afford it. Before I wrap this up, I\'d like to say that I think Richard Gere and Julia Roberts each deserved an Academy Award for their performances. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this star-studded hit to anyone who\'s a fan of Richard Gere or Julia Roberts. You\'ll laugh, you might cry, you\'ll be touched, and you\'ll want to see this box-office smash over and over again.'),
(5, 'I <3 Mr Darcy', '2017-12-18', 1, 5, 'Outstanding ... MacFadyen is a worthy Darcy and a darned good actor to boot! The scenery, backgrounds, and country folk were much more realistic than previous versions. The costumes and hairdos also seemed in keeping with the times. Another great addition is the priceless Donald Sutherland who, in a perfect world, would have had more scenes with Judy Densch. If those two can\'t chew up the scenery, nobody can. And, finally, Keira Knightly is a jewel. Her beauty is so apparent that it almost detracts from the fact that this is a very good actress who can hold her own in any room. This was a delight and I only wish that it could have been 6 hours long.'),
(6, 'Star crossed and starry eyed', '2017-11-07', 2, 6, 'I\'m a sucker for William Shakespeare even though I like it done better in the theatre. This one however, kept my attention and seemed to do a great job with modernizing the whole quarreling families thing. The movie kicks off with a street brawl between the Montegues and Capulets. The Prince forewarns them that if they ever disturb the peace again their \"lives will pay the forfeit of the peace.\" We are then introduced to the character Romeo who is played by Leonardo DeCaprio. Leo does a great job as Romeo, but that\'s because Leo is a good actor in this film. Soon after that we are introduced to Juliet who is played by the beautiful Claire Danes, someone I haven\'t seen in too many movies. Danes does a great job playing the flirty Juliet. The movie follows the original script very accurately. The symbolism is also used very well throughout the movie. If you look at the guns you\'ll notice that some say sword, some say rapier, and I believe some say dagger. The Montegues always wear a Hawaiian style shirt. The Capulets dress more like mobsters or thugs even though both sides could be viewed as thugs in some sort or another. In either case each family wears a certain kind of clothing that makes it easy to tell who\'s who. One great part I absolutely love is the party. Juliet wears angel wings and Romeo wears a knight outfit. Romeo\'s best friend (and I wish I could spell his name but I\'d rather not butcher it) dresses up as a women. So to explain this form of symbolics, for those who aren\'t getting it, it\'s Romeo is the \"knight in shinning armor,\" Juliet is the angel of Romeo\'s dreams, and Romeo\'s best friend is the comic relief. There\'s other things you\'ll notice at the party also, like Tybalt wears devil horns(i.e. he\'s a villain). Both families you\'ll also notice are rich, which also follows the script accurately. Overall, if you\'re a Shakespeare fan, a fan of romantic movies, a fan of tragic movies, or a fan of artistic movies then make sure to look into this one. It\'ll sweep you off you\'re feet, make you laugh, make you cry, and make you fall in love.'),
(7, 'Beastly not beautiful', '2017-10-09', 3, 7, 'The movie from the first scene up to the end was emotionless and spiritless. I do appreciate that they didn\'t want to change the story much and keep the classic version for the most. Even when the movie was slightly tweaked, it was in the wrong dull way. Some tweaks don\'t really make sense and don\'t add up.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know whom should be blamed for the \'emotion delivery failure\' is it the cast or the director? Emma Watson is good actress for some certain roles, but certainly not this one. She was very stiff. We couldn\'t differentiate her surprise from anger or love from sadness. In many scenes Belle and the Beast were talking so fast with no emotions, soul or spirit. It was as if they were rehearsing on a play by reading out loud from their scripts and the director was simply not there.\r\n\r\nCinematography had a problem too. Too many close ups. The original cartoon had some close ups too, but Do they really have to copy everything as-is? The couple dancing scene cinematography could have been better.\r\n\r\nI really don\'t advise anyone to see this movie. Disney failed this time. It happens, though!. Hopefully we\'ll know what really happened.'),
(8, 'Say I\'m a Bird...!', '2017-11-09', 4, 8, 'This amazing love story can be enjoyed by all. The Notebook is not one of those cheesy chick flicks that often come out, it is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to.\r\n\r\nEven most males will agree that this movie pulls at your heart strings. Filled with fabulous quotes, and sentimental moments I found this movie to be one of the best I\'ve seen. I got to know both main characters and found myself relating to each of them. Most of us remember our first love and that strong connection we had with them. This movie makes us think of what could have been and gives us a fresh look at the meaning of true love. I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.'),
(9, 'Richard Curtis at his best', '2017-10-29', 1, 9, 'The effects of personal want, need, love and desire on the friendships of a circle of eclectic individuals is examined with a spot of humor in the witty, clever and oh-so-British comedy of love, romance and finding that special someone, `Four Weddings and a Funeral,\' directed by Mike Newell. Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell head a delightful ensemble cast in this story of a group of long-time friends, all single, who watch and participate over a period of months as one by one those amongst them step up at last to the altar. Of them all, Charles (Grant) seems the most likely-- and at the same time the least likely-- to be next. Young, handsome and charismatic, Charles has no problem developing a relationship (he\'s had a number, in fact, as we learn in one particularly hilarious scene), but sustaining one is seemingly beyond his grasp. Until, at the wedding of one of his friends, he meets Carrie (MacDowell), an American, and she quickly enchants him. It is not the end of the story, however; for Charles, Carrie and the audience, it\'s only-- as they say-- the beginning.'),
(10, 'Lucky me', '2017-11-01', 2, 10, 'I watched this movie on Memorial Day, and was reminded all over again that freedom isn\'t free. So if you are a past or present member of any branch of the US Armed Forces, or if your loved one has paid the ultimate sacrifice with their life, fighting for our freedom, please accept my heartfelt thanks.\r\n\r\nI LOVED this movie. Everyone did an excellent job with their character – especially with Logan. So much feeling and emotion in his expression and actions, even when no words were needed. I felt like I could see into his very soul. I saw a young man who still can hardly grasp the fact that he has survived 3 tours of war in the middle east, when many of his comrades didn\'t come home. You can sense the depth of emotion and turmoil, and can easily understand why it was often hard to just find words to express himself. You can see the military training and discipline, the steel resolve to control his reactions, even when harassed by the town bully/ex-husband. There\'s also loyalty, concern for others, tenderness, selflessness, willingness to work hard – he\'s the man of every woman\'s dream! \r\n\r\nIt\'s easy to see that Beth is a survivor of an extremely abusive marriage. Even though she\'s now divorced, she\'s still not free from the abusive and controlling ex-husband. She\'s very careful in how she responds or endures his abusive threats, in order to keep him from going into a greater rage? and I cheered for her when she finally found the courage to speak up and take control of her own destiny. \r\n\r\nKeith, the ex-husband, is easy to despise, for his hateful, snarly, manipulating character? and yet in the end we saw a little glimpse of good in his soul as well? a little glimpse of what he might have been if he\'d only been willing to humble himself and get help much earlier. \r\n\r\nI loved the happy ending, I loved the story, and I very much appreciated that the producers kept it clean. I can\'t wait for the DVD – this is a keeper!!'),
(11, 'Hot Stuff!', '2018-04-10', 4, 11, 'Hot Fuzz: The story tells us of an over-active \'policeman officer\', Nicholas Angel (Played by the co-star of Shaun of the Dead, Simon Pegg) who is sent to work his duties out in the countryside, to avoid his use of excessive arrests. Suspicions arrive in the town however, as people start getting killed \'accidentally\'. Coupled with his rather unprofessional partner Danny Butterman (Similiarily played by Shaun of the Dead star Nick Frost) they get themselves into suspicious circumstances Nicholas Angel fails to ignore.\r\n\r\nBut what can I say? It\'s just hilarious! An incredibly funny, witty, intelligent British comedy that manages to bring you to tears with laughter and also offers extremely well directed and executed action scenes! If you liked the likes of Shaun of the Dead, you\'ll love this, simple as that. I was oddly surprised to find that it was incredibly violent, albeit, in a cartoony way, but it will definitely make you squint. Plenty of cameo\'s by the likes of the hilarious Bill Bailey and a great cast will make this a action/thriller/comedy hard to forget! Excellent.'),
(12, 'What happens in Vegas...', '2018-02-06', 1, 12, 'I just saw the first screening of the movie, and it is very worth the money you will pay for it. I was skeptical about it at first, thinking that the previews would have only the funny parts, but they are just the tip of the iceberg... Everyone hit a home run in this movie. Even Mike Tyson generated a few laughs for everyone. If you need a pick me up from a bad day, just watch this and you will definitely feel better about everything that may be going wrong in your life. I will DEFINITELY be buying this to watch over and over again once it comes out on DVD, probably even see it in theaters again. I hope you find this review helpful because this movie is definitely a must see in my opinion.');
(13, 'You can\'t sit with us...', '2018-01-28', 3, 13, 'Though my own high school days are well behind me now, this film received enough acclaim that I was convinced to give it a try. Mean Girls did in fact prove to be a rewarding experience. The film made a ton of money and launched some of its young stars into orbit.\r\n\r\nOur story deals with a previously home-schooled girl (Lohan) now having to brave a suburban high school for the first time. She is completely clueless as far as what it takes to be cool in this new world, but she is pretty enough to catch the attention of the most popular girls in the school. The \"Plastics\" as they are called take the young lady into their world and over time she becomes one of them. The more popular the young lady becomes, the more miserable her life becomes, however.\r\n\r\nThe film is very funny and it hits pretty hard with its depictions of the various cliques at modern high schools. Some would argue that the characters in this film are just stereotypes, but so are most real life high schoolers. Nearly everyone fit into one category or another even back in my school days, but things seem even more fragmented now.\r\n\r\nTina Fey has written an intelligent script, and thankfully the film was cast well enough to carry it. Lindsay Lohan is charming, but nothing too exceptional. Rachel McAdams pretty much steals this film, and she is likely the cast member who will have the best career of this bunch. I think it\'s safe to say her scream toward the end of act 2 is the best I\'ve ever heard in any film.Lacey Chabert is also worth mentioning, and she seems worthy of some better roles in the future. Overall, there did not seem to be any casting problems.\r\n\r\nMark Watters keeps things moving along at a brisk pace, and it seems strange to see Lorne Michaels\' name in the credits of any film this funny. From what I\'ve heard, the film had to be trimmed of more than a few parts that would have given it in an R-rating. BOO!!!!!! Hard to argue with the box office totals, though! After watching this film, I was reminded of a similar group of popular girls at my high school. They called themselves the Senior Bitch Patrol, and behaved much the same way as the \"Plastics.\" Only back then (88-91) it was mostly about the hair. The bigger the hair, the more popular the girl. All of these girls have gone on to live boring and pointless lives since those days. Go figure....'),
(14, 'There\'s something in your hair...', '2018-03-04', 4, 14, 'The shock comedy aside (zipper and hair gel scenes), purposeful unpolitically correct moments (humor at expense of handicapped, animal cruelty), the most surprising thing about this film is it has heart and is rather sweet. It\'s not the completely nasty, cruel comedy you might have been expecting. There\'s a nice love story in here too. It\'s corny and cliche\'d and doesn\'t feel overly cloying because there are enough shockingly funny moments to offset it. The acting is good, the pacing brisk, and the jokes, well... you\'ve heard all about the best ones by now.'),
(15, 'Supergood, actually', '2018-04-03', 3, 15, 'Superbad is a teen movie. It also will draw comparisons to American Pie, in it\'s \"losers try to get laid\" themes, and occasional gross-out comedy. But the comparison is unfair - Superbad is a funnier, more subversive and more importantly genuine movie than American Pie or any of it\'s awful sequels were. The three central characters have a believable, likable relationship, that the film takes time to establish. Cera, Hill (who deserves special praise, for turning what could have been a really unlikeable character into a sweet, if loud-mouthed and crass, teenager) and Mintz-Plasse bounce of each other perfectly. The movie creates some funny situations, and more importantly, hilarious dialogue throughout. Aside from one comedic misfire - an overly long (and poorly judged) gross out sight gag involving a pair of trousers and a dance - Superbad had me laughing constantly. It\'s sweet, it\'s funny as hell, and it\'s established a load of new talent.'),
(16, 'An Education in Rock', '2018-02-07', 2, 16, 'Dewey Finn is a lazy freeloader and a guitarist in a rock band who plays gigs every night and sleeps every day, in his friend Ned Schneebly\'s apartment. One day as he shows up late for band practice he notices a new guitar player who is replacing him. Poor Dewey feels so bad about it and also about Ned and his girlfriend threatening to kick him out since he doesn\'t pay any of the bills. After a few days of trying to sell his guitars, which doesn\'t go very well, the head of a school calls and asks for Ned Schneebly, who is a talented substitute teacher with a good reputation. In a desperate attempt to getting money fast, Dewey impersonates Ned and conveniently finds himself the teacher of a third grade ( or something like that ) class for several weeks ahead. Yet another one of his crazy ideas strikes him and his plan to turn his class into a rockband to win the Battle of the Bands competition is set in motion. \r\n\r\nSchool Of Rock is a great feel-good comedy, fun for just about anyone of any age, kids or adults. Jack Black does carry a lot of this film on his own but I won\'t be too harsh on the kids in the movie, they did very well also. If anyone else should play Dewey Finn rather than Jack, it just wouldn\'t be the same. Since Jack is actually in a rock band in real life, and has played a few characters in films before who are also into music, he just seemed to fit right into this film. His real passion for rock music helps a lot in this film, and makes Dewey Finn one hell of a good character. The plot to this film is really good I think and Mike White did a great job on the screenplay. As did Linklater on the direction of the film.\r\n\r\nThis comedy should not be ignored just because there are kids in it, I enjoyed it a hell of a lot and you probably will too. '),
(17, 'Carrey on Jim', '2017-11-07', 1, 17, 'Ace Ventura is the kind of comedy that stems directly from a TV show, and in this case, that show was probably In Living Color, where Carrey got most of his publicity before he became famous as a movie actor. A quick look through Carrey\'s filmography will prove that Ace Ventura is the film that really acted as a springboard for his career. He had a few small roles in films previous to Ace Ventura, the largest of which was probably his role as one of the aliens in the awful film Earth Girls Are Easy, but after Ace Ventura, his career skyrocketed. The Mask (hey, he\'s still new, give the guy a break), Dumb & Dumber, a sequel to Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy (oops), The Truman Show (ah, better), Man On The Moon, Me, Myself & Irene, The Grinch, and there\'s no end in sight.\r\n\r\nSure, Ace Ventura does not compare to half of these movies, and is clearly more on the side of the bone-headed comedy that he was doing on In Living Color, but his talent is unmistakable. I first saw this movie when I was in high school, and I remember that I would ditch school and go to the theater to see it and I would laugh hysterically until my sides hurt every time I saw it. There\'s something about seeing a slob at a tremendously rich party who just doesn\'t care about the etiquette of the rich people. Did anyone not laugh when he was `testing\' the food at Ron Kamp\'s I\'m-the-richest-man-in-the-universe party and stuck his tongue out at that poor guy next to him? That whole scene at that party is classic!\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, it only gets better with Ace\'s dealings with Lois Einhorn. The whole crying game idea may have gone a little too far, but it was always amusing. Jim Carrey saves Ace Ventura from sinking to the totally brainless level of more recent crapfests as the Scary Movies, and even makes this into one of the better comedies of 1994. This is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards, but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and Jim Carrey\'s immediately recognizable rubber-faced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career, which later brought us many more excellent movies. Way to go, Jim.'),
(18, 'Dog eat dog', '2017-12-05', 4, 18, 'Christopher Guest\'s Best of Show follows his great tradition of fake-documentaries which includes This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman. This time, he takes a poke at dog shows, which is something no one has done before (I think). Here, he shows 5 different contenders (including himself which is one of the great parts of this film). Other contenders include Michael McKean, Michael Hitchcock, Catherine O\'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, John Michael Higgins, Parker Posey and in a exceptional effort as a man with 2 left feet, Eugene Levy (he also co-wrote the script with Guest). Often very funny, sometimes poignant, and like all of Guest\'s projects, never dissapointing, only liability might be that it isn\'t for all tastes (but hey, not everyone found 11 on a sound stsyem great either which seems odd).'),
(19, 'Never in doubt', '2018-02-07', 3, 19, 'Many people say that \"Mrs.Doubtfire\" is one of the funniest movies ever made in the U.S. I agree with the above idea for the following two reasons. First,performance of the voice of Robin Williams is very wonderful.For example, he uses a lot of funny ad lib in the stand-in of animation in the first scene. Second, Robin Williams and Sally Field as well as the three children act very delightfully though the movie deals with a rather serious theme---warmth and importance of family. Some people say Sally Field doesn\'t act well in this movie. But, I think that she acts a role of a wife whom is worried about her husband excelentlly. We feel big love of both father and mother toward children. It is not only a real funny comedy but also a real wonderful family movie.'),
(20, 'Vote for Pedro!', '2017-12-04', 1, 20, 'OK, I have seen a lot of negative reviews on this movie. It made me leery of even seeing it. I work at a video store so I get to see movies before their street release date. There were a few naysayers at work, but I rented it anyway. This was a rental well spent. This is the first movie I have seen in some time that doesn\'t have swear words or sex in any form so it is OK for any age. If you are or ever were just a little bit geeky, Napoleon is the hero for you. This movie is much funnier to a gen-x\'er. There are a lot of things that you won\'t \"get\" if you weren\'t a part of the 80\'s. All in all, I think that it is a great way to spend an evening. I am looking forward to seeing more from this writer/director.'),
(21, 'Alien Invasion', '2017-12-01', 3, 21, 'What\'s the fuss about this movie? Why does everyone think so poorly of this? Well, in my opinion they compare this film to the Best Picture movies. This is not a Best Picture film, but a very entertaining popcorn film. This tells the tale of aliens attacking Earth and a group of survivors must unite together to destroy the invading aliens. The acting is decent. Will Smith, with a movie career underway, is excellent. Bill Pullman is great as the President. The effects were amazing especially when the buildings were blown up. David Arnold\'s music score is just fantastic. The theme is still stuck in my head. Overall, this is an excellent film.'),
(22, 'Don\'t be afraid of the dark', '2018-01-02', 3, 22, 'I will admit, I was already a fan of Serenity, Riddick Chronicles and all that, so I did go into this film with a bit of predetermined anticipation. On the flip side, I\'m not always that much of a Vin Deisel fan, in that he is somewhat mono-dimensional in his range of characters, but for the embodiment of Riddick, he does fit perfectly. As for the story and how it plays out, the pace is good, not too encumbered with gratuitous special effects and all that, but where it does fit, the CGI is well done and appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe one really glaring technical defect in this story is how everyone just gets out and starts walking around, breathing in the air without the slightest concern for differences in the atmosphere, microbes and so on, but this is a common flaw that is often somehow glossed over in many such stories, so I can\'t harp on that detail too much.\r\n\r\nAs for Radha Mitchell, she is smokin\' hot here, not in a ridiculous or frivolous way, but as her tough, seasoned interplanetary merchant marine ship\'s captain character \"Fry\", she nails it perfectly. If anything, she very much reminds me of Andrea Osvart (see her as the Hungarian assassin \"Gilda\" in the film \"Two Tigers\").'),
(23, 'A gigantic family film', '2017-12-06', 3, 23, 'All too often, \"family films\" are only infantile, simplistic formulas with a few self-referential and pop-culture jokes thrown in to try and keep adults awake. But then along comes something like \"The Iron Giant\", which is sophisticated enough to demand respect while maintaining a mythic and pure-hearted tone that actually does appeal to the kid in everybody.\r\n\r\n\"The Iron Giant\" is refreshingly non-Disney in no end of ways. Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story, instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula. The animation definitely has its eye-popping moments, but there are also scenes of great wonderment, pathos, and humour that only top-drawer animation can convey. The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney). No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the \"world\" of the movie, or to advance the plot. At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again.\r\n\r\n\"The Iron Giant\" is funny, exhilarating, and touching as well. It\'s sad to see it failing at the box office, as a blunt reminder that the success of films is often in direct proportion to their publicity budget. Hopefully, though, word-of-mouth will come to its rescue. Go see it! Tell your friends! Then go again! (Repeat as necessary.)'),

What JJ Abrams has done is create a film that can be enjoyed by all, its irrelevant whether or not you have seen Star Trek before, this film stands alone as brilliant entertainment. There are plenty of references to the original series to keep the fans happy. Of course there are going to be the \"hard core\" fans who will criticize certain aspects. I enjoyed seeing the lead actors imitate the characteristics of the original crew, Karl Urban as Dr Mcoy was particularly good. Good story line, plenty of humour, non-stop fast action, fantastic special effects, great acting from all the main \"crew\", Zacchary Quinto and Chris Pine especially. Can\'t wait for the next one to see more in-depth character development (of all the characters, not just Kirk and Spock and a moral dilemma which is at the heart of the best Star Trek.

When completed, it will spell certain doom for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the Rebels. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is a prisoner of crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) soon finds herself in the gangster\'s hands. Luke Skywalker, aided by C-3PO and R2-D2, makes his way into Jabba\'s palace, hoping to secure his friends\' freedom. But the Hutt has no intention of doing so and tries to kill them all. After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the Rebel fleet, which is massing for an attack against the new satellite battle station at Endor. Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is pressed into action to lead the Rebel fighter attack, while Han is put in charge of a group of soldiers to take out the shield generator protecting the Death Star. Luke, however, surrenders to Vader\'s soldiers on Endor, and is taken in front of Vader\'s boss - the Galactic Emperor - on the Death Star for final corruption to the Dark Side of the Force. The fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers ambushes the Rebels, cutting them off. Worse, the new Death Star begins turning its giant laser on the Rebel carriers.

It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man\'s suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn\'t go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I\'ve always considered one of Marvel\'s most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic\'s 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn\'t do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr\'s performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don\'t come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn\'t quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own.'),

(29, 'Dark times for Donnie', '2017-12-18', 3, 29, 'In the end, _Donnie Darko_ is a film about people who feel life and all the emotions within it very deeply. Donnie himself is a basically sweet-tempered (often courageous) young man who is pathologically terrified of loneliness and the thought of spiritual isolation. His quest for meaning and self-discovery drives him to the fringes of our reality, which only serves to isolate him more from the world he loves. The few who understand what Donnie is going through go largely unnoticed (such as his girlfriend Gretchen or a tragically overweight yet remarkable sensitive little girl) or unappreciated (such as Karen, the English teacher whose only sin is trying to show her students that there is no such thing as a true end.)\r\n\r\nOf course, this movie far from polarizes its characters (indeed, polarization is the last thing this film wants to accomplish) and the majority are just a mishmash of the beautiful and the grotesque: Donnie\'s parents, who are at the same time loving and perpetually confused; the aforementioned self-helper Jim Cunningham, who is desperate to spread the lie that keeps him sane to everybody else; and Donnie\'s sister, struggling between her identity as an adult and her identity as a child. And then there\'s Frank. All I can say here is that nothing can prepare you for or adequately describe Frank.\r\n\r\nProbably the best thing about this movie, though, is its incredible emotional range. It manages to inspire hope, love, dread, laughter, and tears at different points throughout the movie without making you feel least bit like there is a contradiction between those states. The scenes with Frank (especially the one that takes place in the therapist\'s office against the backdrop of a conversation about the end of the world) are quite frankly some of the scariest things I\'ve ever seen in a movie, as they literally made my skin crawl.\r\n\r\nFinally, the performances in this film are exquisite. The talent in this film is top notch and even Gyllenhall is just amazing. That said, though, this film has a dismal future. Combine the fact that the large majority of the moviegoing public is just going to find it unbearably weird with the fact that the movie begins with part of an airplane crashing into a building (this has got to be the very definition of bad timing) and it\'s pretty clear that this film is going to stay underground. However, if you are looking for a beautiful experience with a unique film, _Donnie Darko_ is just about as good as it gets.'),

The immediate grabbing feature of this movie is its score, very imaginatively composed and created by Alan Silvestri whose other credits include the Back to the Future series and other gems like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The tempo and build up which the score lends to the film engage its viewers with feelings of fear and nerve wracking suspense for what lurks within the thick of the forest. Take note of Sonny Landham\'s comment;\"there\'s something out there,and it ain\'t no man.\r\n\r\nThe action is fast, furious and merciless. The commandos are killed off one by one, leaving Arnie, Carl Weathers and the surviving members extremely terrified and on the verge of breaking down. Note the heated arguments that some of the commandos get into with each other. There is very animated and fiery action in the beginning (assault on the terrorist camp) but as we are introduced to the true terror of the jungle (or should I say, outer space), the action takes a turn for the more insane eg.Arnie running away armed only with a knife and trembling in fear, almost drowning in a waterfall and thereafter, continually pursued by the Predator). All this followed by a half hour long jungle battle mano a mano with spears, rocks and fists and hall deafening yells by both warriors. Very, very fierce and macho stuff I assure you all.\r\n\r\nI shall not go into the other intricacies of the film and will leave it to the curiosity of potential/virgin viewers to find out for themselves. \"Predator\" is essentially one of the few action movies that truly lives up to its name and delivers the thrills and spills in no small amount and at breakneck speed.

(31, 'Horrifically Good', '2017-12-01', 1, 31, 'While \"The Babadook\" may display some of the hallmarks of the traditional horror film, there\'s a lot more going on here than meets the eye. Far from the typical Hollywood bloodfest so brilliantly satired in \"Cabin in the Woods,\" this film\'s characters are layered, its plot is mercurial, its actions are metaphorical, and its conclusions are ambiguous. All this is likely to disappoint those filmgoers who need to be spoonfed a formula. But if you\'re a film lover, Do. Not. Miss. This.\r\n\r\nDirector Jennifer Kent understands what most horror filmmakers fail to grasp: that our biggest fear isn\'t of crazy killers or monsters or ghosts, but of ourselves—what lives inside us, the emotions we have to live with, the illusory veil of self-control. \r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around a mum, her troubled son and the book he pulls off the shelf one night. But you already know too much. This is one film where knowing less going into it will really pay dividends. Really, don\'t even watch the trailer.\r\n\r\nJust know that the storytelling and craft are flawless. Essie Davis delivers one of the most challenging performances put to screen with total commitment and credibility. Kent\'s storytelling is utterly absorbing and she so delicately treads the line between what\'s real and what\'s not that you can never be sure of yourself. \r\n\r\nWhat you make of \"The Babadook\" will depend on who you are. You might take it at face value, as a creepy monster flick with all the constant threat and looming dread and shocking moments. You might take it as an attempt to capture the authentic experience of mental illness. You might take it as a symbolic story using a metaphor for grief and loss. The best films make you feel something and allow you the room to make sense of it yourself.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I thought about this film for days after seeing it, both because of its ambiguity and because of the themes it explores, namely mental illness and domestic violence. Yes, it\'s scary. But it\'s also touching and heartbreaking. While \"The Babadook\" belongs alongside other great psychological horror films, like \"The Innocents\" and \"The Haunting\" (1963), to classify it purely as \"horror\" really belittles its accomplishment as a film that challenges us to examine and discuss issues we are very uncomfortable tackling in reality.'),

Laurie Holden (of X-Files and Silent Hill fame) has a more subdued performance but plays her role well and for any X-Files nut (such as myself) it\'s fun to see her in another movie. The cast is chock full of well known actors and some unknowns that really see and express the writer and directors vision. It pays off: They succeed in pulling you into a traumatic situation made worse with a mixture of religious zealotry, military conspiracy, and small-town ignorance that explodes in your face wondering if your humanity is worse off facing The Mist or the human condition.\r\n\r\nThere is no spoiler here but I will say this about the ending: It\'s what makes the movie and makes it so much better than most of the crap put out there in horror land. Yes, yes, getting cut in half and having limbs ripped-off is horrible. However it is the decisions we have to make that concern those we love and respect that can really drive one mad. The ending makes you look at yourself and wonder, if given the same situation, what you would have to do with the information you have available. It makes you think hard about your humanity and your soul and about what is right or wrong in any given situation involving our mortality.\r\n\r\nI would suggest this movie to anyone that likes horror or science fiction and wants something a little more intense than, say, Army of Darkness (one of my personal favorites for totally different reasons). This movie deals with serious issues we hear about daily. The mist is just a piece of Science Fiction thrown in to bring out the best...and worst in us.'),

The cinematography is electrifying, every shot is beautiful and the score holds brilliance, it carries a very obvious John Carpenter vibe to it. The tension is raw, avoiding cheap jump scares and relies on music. Its eerie atmosphere is extremely effective keeping you inches above your seat for the majority of the runtime. The characters are interesting, providing depth and emotional attachment, most modern horror films seem to forget the importance of character development, its nice to see the genre hasn\'t completely lost it yet. There are several jumps scares, but they work, as they are not carried with unnecessary piecing music jolts but with the use of disturbing and sudden imagery.\r\n\r\nThe only errors I could detect were the unconventional editing style, the transitions were a little dodgy lacking fluency, this left the film to appear choppy at times but this flaw can be easily forgiven. Its outstanding cinematography and soundtrack make up for this. The film leaves a daunting stain of disturbing after effects that follow you for a long while, with a constant reminder to always check behind your back. An exceptional low budget indie horror film, strongly recommend.'),

Simón is HIV positive and tells Laura that he has five invisible friends, and she believes they are fruit of his imagination. Laura decides to reopen an orphanage for handicapped children in the location and during the opening party, Simón calls her to show the little cabin of his friend Tomás. The busy Laura does not gives much attention to her son; then she sees a mysterious masked boy and Simón vanishes. Laura feels the presence of other persons in the house and months later, the desperate Laura invites a team of parapsychologists to try to unravel the mystery.\r\n\r\n\"El Orfanato\" is a creepy and spooky ghost story with a dark and very sad atmosphere. The screenplay, direction, acting and cinematography are great, disclosing a dramatic and sensitive plot that explores the disappearance of a young boy with touches of supernatural in the despair of his mother. However, the explanation of the mystery in the end makes this sensitive movie actually a drama, and not horror genre, and maybe that is the reason why some viewers have written bad reviews (or maybe they have not understood the plot).'),

The music is very nicely done, and, to me, the eerie opening scenes of the empty London streets are worth the price of admission all on their own. I\'m a stubborn viewer, and, normally, when a film benefits from early critical buzz in the manner that this one did, I find some excuse not to like it. But not this time; I\'m completely impressed. (Incidentally, I think it\'s interesting that while most horror films these days seem to have been inspired by knockoffs of knockoffs, \"28 Days Later\" apparently owes more to John Wyndham\'s classic disaster novel \"The Day of the Triffids\" than to anything else.

It\'s almost impossible to convey how pumped I am now that I\'ve seen it. I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn\'t be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. I\'m so happy to report just the opposite has happened.\r\n\r\nThe only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It\'s amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It\'s exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure. It has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see. One of the MANY things I loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members. It\'s not a two dimensional \"team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho.\" Most don\'t like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played. That is great because so many of these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns aren\'t used to working with other people or even playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work \"the other side of the fence\" so to speak. Then there\'s the Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all thrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible.\r\n\r\nThe entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype train I talked about but I\'m so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope he\'s locked up for the long haul because we don\'t need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that we\'ve seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as Stark. He\'s great but it\'s hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also have to fully disclose that I\'m insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but I\'m definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.\r\n\r\nI honestly don\'t want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored. Do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. It\'s how I saw the movie (apart from what the trailers showed) and even though you\'re obviously reading this review, read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever. Experience the awesomeness for yourself. Avengers as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force. I\'m just going to say, Hulk & Thor combination equals AWESOME and leave it at that.

I don\'t usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. \"The Dark Knight\" is certainly loud and violent but it\'s not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience.

Given an A-picture budget by Warners, Siegel delivered a tremendously taut thriller, as provocatively amoral as anything he had done in his 20-year career of expert B-pics like The Killers.\r\n\r\nDirty Harry also gave Eastwood a definitive Hollywood identity after leaving spaghetti westerns behind. It may lack the humour of Siegel and Eastwood\'s first collaboration, Coogan\'s Bluff, but it packs a much more uneasy political punch.\r\n\r\nInspector Harry Callaghan is the taciturn, laconic spokesman of Nixon\'s Silent Majority, elevated to iconic status. His dialogue with criminals is delivered behind the barrel of a devastatingly phallic Magnum hand-gun. \"Feel lucky, punk?\" he taunts one wounded miscreant in a famous line he repeats at the end of the film.\r\n\r\nThere\'s just enough moral ambiguity about Harry in this film to escape it being an endorsement of vigilantism ? but if it poses resonating questions about how a liberal society can be held hostage by those outside the law, it also contrives a worryingly two-dimensional picture of psycho-killer Scorpio (Andy Robinson) - and of Harry, himself ? with which to frame those questions.\r\n\r\nMade by the veteran director in the same year as Hollywood-new wave young gun William Friedkin shot The French Connection, it\'s just as coolly authoritative and exciting. Siegel uses Bruce Surtees\' always serviceable photography of San Francisco locations with flair (years before, he had shot the low-budget but excellent The Line-Up there). The swooping helicopter shot out of the baseball stadium, as if to rush the audience away (either as witnesses or as voyeurs) as Eastwood presses his foot on Scorpio\'s wounded leg, shows Siegel\'s smooth mastery of the medium.\r\n\r\nSiegel made the insouciant Charley Varrick with Walter Matthau next, after which his career went into slow decline.'),

The characters are memorable, the script is great, and Indiana is still pulling in the action packed excitement continuing from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The direction, editing, even the special effects are great. You have to love Short Round and Willy, the two new side kicks to Indiana\'s new adventure. Now I agree, Willy can get a little annoying here and there, but she was just so hilarious in that scene with the bugs and having to save Indiana and Short Round. Plus, Short Round has some of the most memorable lines of the entire series \"Okey, dokey, Dr. Jones, hold on to your potato!\", cheesy, but so funny. Harrison Ford still has Indiana down to a tee, this was the role that was meant for him.\r\n\r\nIn this prequel, we start off in China on a trade off gone wrong with Lao Che, he ends up meeting a beautiful and very high maintence American girl, Willie.

With Christopher Nolan of \"Memento\" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, \"Inception\" is a bloated failure.\r\n\r\nThe root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What\'s going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that\'s the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.\r\n\r\nThe matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn\'t nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it\'s time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.\r\n\r\nNolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination. (Okay, that\'s never gonna happen, but it\'s *my* dream.)'),
(52, 'Black beauty', '2017-12-19', 3, 52, 'I will not give away any spoilers so as not to possibly ruin the experience for anyone, but I can say that this movie left me shaking when it was over. What did I just see? I know I was caught up and went for the entire ride from the opening scene till the very end. The reaction of the audience was evident as the end credits came. NO ONE left their seats. They sat and applauded loudly the names as they scrolled up, then upon the very last credit on the screen, they applauded loudly again.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a brilliant piece of film making and story telling and acting. \"Black Swan\", as well as \"The King\'s Speech\", will DOMINATE at the 2011 Oscars and Golden Globes and whatever other films awards show there is... AND deservedly so.\r\n\r\nI am anxious to see the film again right away with friends, but will actually wait to continue to savor the feeling the initial viewing of the film still illicit in me. It was a thrilling time and I am looking forward to seeing just how successful this film will become and what my friends and family will say.'),
(53, 'It crashes and burns', '2018-04-04', 4, 53, 'The film tells several extraordinary stories happening over the scope of a few days and connects them using implausible coincidences. This makes it difficult to suspend disbelief during the entire film. All the stories share the same motif: There is good and bad in all of us, and racism has complex causes. There is little variation and little originality in the presentation of this theme.\r\n\r\nI think the makers of the film were aware of this, and tried to make the film more interesting by arranging it chronologically in such a way that the process of the different pieces of the puzzle coming together is meant to be interesting. Both the film title and the introductory dialogue allude to this, but to me it seemed like a poor excuse not to tell rich, conclusive and well-developed stories.\r\n\r\nI do appreciate movies that do not follow a simplistic good/evil pattern; I would have liked to see a more developed and refined story of Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) and his interaction with Shaniqua and his father, for example. But there are too many plot lines to make any single one stand out, and as a consequence, the characters seem artificial rather than realistic. (As a European, I cannot judge whether the individual subcultures portrayed at all resemble reality.) The movie is not \"trash\" as some reviewers have called it, but it is forgettable and certainly not deserving of an Academy Award. As opposed to \"Brokeback Mountain\", I doubt anyone will talk much about \"Crash\" in 20 years.'),
(54, 'Not such a lucky number', '2017-12-08', 3, 54, 'This movie is from start to finish a well produced and directed film. The performances in this movie are outstanding. Brad Pitt, once again, makes his role a stand-out performance by putting his versatile acting skills into his interpretation of Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is well-cast. His brooding acting style fits the character (Detective William Somerset) like a glove, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives her best performance EVER in the role of Brad Pitt\'s supportive wife/lover (Tracy Mills). And of course, Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer.\r\n\r\nThe movie is suspenseful and in parts very exciting. There is a \"Pseudo-Noir\" quality to this movie that really fits in well with the content of the film (Serial Killing). It has it\'s philosophical moments that anyone who thinks a lot about the state of the world today can appreciate. It makes subtle moral judgements without insulting any beliefs that the viewer may have and it also generates debate for any post-film coffee/drinks gathering.\r\n\r\nAndrew Kevin Walker (Screenplay) has taken the subject of the Seven Deadly Sins and he really puts a great new twist on these themes. As a writer, I really could appreciate the depth that he goes into with these ideas. The movie gives us just enough information to be entertained and informed yet not bombarded and made bored with too much philosophy. In this respect, the film doesn\'t \"preach\" any special meaning even though the film\'s moral statements are still maintained. This film can be enjoyed on so many levels and I really enjoyed the third act. One of the best pieces of storytelling and scriptwriting ever.\r\n\r\nOutstanding performances from everyone involved (And yes, of course, David Fincher does a wonderful job) Say no more.'),
(55, 'Watch this film noir ce soir', '2018-03-19', 4, 55, 'Channel surfing late one night I stumbled across this film and stopped to look because of the unusual cinematography. It\'s visually stunning, mostly in b&w and that evokes a film noir atmosphere punctuated with those brilliant flashes of color. Two minutes later I couldn\'t take my eyes away. This unique film is superbly executed, the casting, the screenplay, the special effects, everything about it. As we all know, there is an expansive library of film work out there for a wide range of tastes and sensibilities. If yours are delicate, if you are offended by gore and violence, then this film will NOT be your cup of tea. Stay away from it. But if both the horror and film noir genres appeal to you, you\'ll probably find this movie as captivating as I did.'),
(56, 'Shut your eyes for this', '2018-01-03', 2, 56, 'I hate to say this as much anyone else but for me this film had a horribly disappoint ending. First before I delve into that I\'d like to say that the acting, the writing, the shooting, the film in general as far as quality goes was very good. But the ending was very disappointing. And no I am no idiot or newbie when it comes to film. But I thought the was very much a cop out. Now granted I know this is based off of a novel, hence there are certain restraints to adhering to this novel somewhat. That being said I found the idea of the medical experimentation, mental hospital, nazi experiments, and astray patients much more tantalizing, realistic, and more full of potential. The trick ending where its all in someone\'s head is done far too often sadly. I was hoping that while it dragged one there at the end it would ultimately reveal he was playing them or that he would stay true and not give in. But that didn\'t happen. I guess for me I was just expecting something not so cliché for an ending from the likes of Scorsese\'s genius mind. But all things said and done I definitely can\'t give this movie all negative remarks, wonderfully acted and scripted. Great atmosphere, shooting, photography, etc. But I feel the ending should have been less cliché or not as cheap I guess. Felt like it was just an easy way out and not fully developing the tension and intrigue that they had built throughout. But either way its each to their own, so maybe you will appreciate the ending more than I. FYI - I do understand the undertones of the ending and the ambiguity, but I don\'t think that saves the ending or does the film justice in it\'s entirety.'),
(57, '94 minutes of anxiety', '2017-12-27', 1, 57, 'A hiking and climbing trip in the mountains of Utah goes wrong for rock-climber Aron Ralston (James Franco) as a loose boulder falls and crushes his arm against the rock wall. Equipped with a half-empty bottle of water, a digital camera, some rope and a (very) dull blade, Ralston must take stock of the situation and figure out a way to escape.\r\n\r\nThe film is tight, pacey and not nearly as boring as it could have been in the hands of a more literal director. Danny Boyle and co. infuse every scene with energy, wowing viewers with panoramic cinematography and drilling the hard truths home when the time comes.\r\n\r\nRalston gets his arm trapped a mere 15 minutes in and from then on it\'s Man vs. Rock. Boyle brings his distinctive brand of energy to the potentially static set-up, with an unpredictable and often inspired soundtrack and the surreal tangents so successfully employed in his early classic, \'Trainspotting\'. Though Ralston himself may not move, his mind wanders through old memories and viewers are transported with him.\r\n\r\nBoyle has a talent for finding the life-affirming elements hidden deep within grim situations and \'127 Hours\' is nothing if not an exercise in hope and determination. Franco tracks Ralston\'s fight over the days with a sense of realism that brings the climber\'s plight into sharp focus, ensuring that there is much more to this film than limb-hacking.\r\n\r\nThe premise is handled well and the cast and crew know the strengths of the story; the scenery is beautiful and the human elements are as familiar as they are sad, brave and ultimately liberating. When the time comes, having accompanied Ralston through his trials and setbacks, you will be there with him when the helicopter lands.'),
(58, 'Memorable', '2017-09-04', 2, 58, 'So the \"innovative\" concept of filming out of sequence has been cliche for at least a few years now, but here\'s a film that makes it work far better than its been shown in a while.\r\n\r\nHaving read the reviews and talked to others who saw it, I thought that I\'d go into the movie figuring everything out right away and declaring the concept unworkable. I couldn\'t be further from the truth. This movie does things to your head that are illegal in some countries. Portrayed (for all intents and purposes) backwards, it forces you to think in the same way that our lead character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce being more brilliant than usual) does. Suffering from a condition that renders him unable to remember anything for more than a few minutes, he is searching for the man who raped and killed his wife. Since each seen lasts no more than 15 minutes before jumping back to the what happened before that, our perceptions are shattered in the same way.\r\n\r\nCarrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) put in great performances that leave you guessing; simultaneously endearing and revolting.\r\n\r\nOverall I left the film trying to figure out what was what, and I\'m still not sure. This film noir concept shouldn\'t work, but it does so wonderfully.'),
(59, 'Not as good as the book :(', '2017-11-14', 2, 59, 'Dark and twisted, David Fincher\'s stylish new mystery thriller was derived from Gillian Flynn\'s intriguingly slick tale from her complex and suspenseful novel. By far one of the best acting performances to have come from Ben Affleck, \'Gone Girl\' boasts some strong yet disturbing portrayals from Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry and Affleck. Fincher has garnered fame and recognition as a mainstream director, that is not only able to engulf the audience within the picture, but actually make them part of the scenario. Fincher exercises upon his trademarks with the swift and stunning cinematography, the chilling score and tight editing, all of which makes \'Gone Girl\' a movie full of great visual storytelling.'),

If you can come up with a story based in a single room and make it as engaging and exciting as this one... you deserve to be frozen and preserved for future teaching of inspiring film makers. This is a fantastic film and I\'m glad Jodie Foster was available for the lead when Nicole Kidman got knocked up and bailed. I loved the off-character casting of Jared Leto and the unbelievable casting of Dwight Yoakam... DWIGHT YOAKAM. Everything worked. Another great, and yet again... underrated film by David Fincher. How long is it going to take for an established directed like Fincher to take a chance and roll the dice on trying to make a script like this work again? ...No one has the guts.\r\n\r\n'),
(61, 'Black and white', '2017-09-14', 3, 61, 'I\'ve watched this film about half a dozen times over the last five years and I still don\'t really understand what Spielberg was trying to do. Was he trying to outline the horrors of the holocaust or was he trying to examine Schindler himself - why the man did what he did? Maybe both. In neither case does he succeed. One can\'t help but feel the atrocities were greatly toned down for this film thus not really reflecting the true horror of what really happened, and he fails completely in exploring the character of Schindler. Why did Schindler do what he did? The man was a philanderer and a shrewd business man who didn\'t exactly go out of his way to be nice. Did witnessing what he did make him wake up to himself or perhaps there was an ulterior motive? Spielberg looks at none of this and serves up a modern day saint. It is kind of ironic that Spielberg shot this movie in black and white because that is the approach he has taken to his subject material. He gives us the saintly Schindler, the stereotypical evil Nazi, the honourable Jew and none of the complexities that made these people what they are. This was Spielberg\'s attempt to become accepted as a serious film-maker but yet he takes exactly the same approach to making this as he did with his marvellous popcorn movies resulting in a rather dictatorial film that has more answers than questions!'),

Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it. It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I\'ve seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe. One for the ages.'),
(63, 'Miles upon miles of film', '2017-10-03', 2, 63, 'Having doubts about seeing this movie because of the length (3 hours can be death to a film).I was so surprised that I didn\'t look at my watch once throughout the whole movie. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he\'s carrying his own movie. If you haven\'t seen this get it out now,forget about the running time and connections to \'The Shawshank Redemption\' and enjoy it for what it is, a little miracle.'),
(64, 'Sunny with cloudy intervals', '2018-04-09', 1, 64, 'We were happy to have had the chance to see this at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. I loved the cast: Greg Kinear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, Paul Dano and Steve Carrell were ALL marvelous as the dysfunctional family. Little Miss Sunshine refers to a pageant to be held in California (the movie never states where the family lives, but most of the road scenes were definitely in the Phoenix, Arizona area. (added 8/2/06: I know now that the movie is set in New Mexico, for those of you who are interested in that sort of thing!)\r\n\r\nThe story follows little Olive, a normal child, who by a fluke wins her way into the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The family decides they must accompany her in their old VW bus, so a road trip ensues.\r\n\r\nThe final third of the movie, which deals with the actual pageant, is by far the funniest part of the film. It illustrates, with great hilarity, the frightening people who are involved in child pageants. You can\'t help rooting for Olive, who is refreshingly normal amongst the frighteningly plastic other contestants.\r\n\r\n(After discovering that I was in the (opposite of loved it) category on IMDb, I changed my subject line, because this was one of the best movies I\'ve seen all year!! I LOVED IT)\r\n\r\nThis is NOT a movie for children. After reading through some other user comments, I have to say I\'m dismayed by the amount of people complaining about the F word. This movie is rated R, mostly because of its frequent use of the F word, along with some drug use. If you do 5 minutes of research before you go to a movie, you should educate yourself as to WHY a movie is rated the way it is. If you are offended by swearing, then, if you go to a movie that is rated R because of language, be prepared to be offended! Okay, I\'m off the soapbox. This is NOT a movie for children.'),

Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn\'t as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don\'t like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there\'s no hope... I just love this movie.

(66, 'A modern masterpiece', '2018-01-07', 4, 66, 'Take the direction of Alejandro González Iñárritu, combine it with the stunning cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki and toss in Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy for their acting charms and what do you get? An extraordinary and masterful film.\r\n\r\nFresh off of \'Birdman,\' Iñárritu moved straight on to \'The Revenant,\' a western-epic inspired by the true-life experiences of frontiersman Hugh Glass in the winter-struck landscape of 1820s America. The film gained some notoriety in mid-2015 for its production problems and has thus been regarded one of the most challenging film shoots in the history of cinema. Rightfully so. The film opens with the soothing sound of running water, thrusting the audience into an almost meditative state, and then it strikes, an action-packed sequence ensues with a near single sweeping take. Now this is a spoiler-free review, so I\'ll leave the pleasure of viewing that scene to you.\r\n\r\nThis film heavily evokes reactions from the audience and does so well, whether it\'s staring at the screen in awe or gasping at the visceral violence, if you face this film with the right attitude and expectations, it will be a thrill ride like no other. Lubezki has proved that he is one of the most fantastic cinematographers of modern cinema, and the extensive use of natural lighting over artificial supports that statement even further, the film is beyond stunning. Supporting this is the score from the relatively unknown composers, believe me, when the sudden orchestral boom strikes your eardrums, it\'s mesmerising.\r\n\r\nThe makeup, the direction, the editing, the visual aesthetics, and of course the performances from a hopefully soon-to-be Oscar winning DiCaprio, \'The Revenant\' is a visual treat for those who appreciate cinema and for those who wish to just get absorbed by the immense landscapes and poetic justice Iñárritu has given it. This is, for me, a modern masterpiece.'),
(67, 'A tale of two brothers', '2017-10-24', 4, 67, 'I have seen this movie only recently (2005) and it\'s easily one of the better foreign films I have seen. Actually, it\'s probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe characters really make this movie come alive with each of their compelling personalities shining though in the backdrop of oppressive conditions and constant violence. One thing which clearly comes to mind is \"Lil\' Dice\'s\" ear to ear smile - so vivid and yet so ironic since he personifies pure evil.\r\n\r\nThe City of God is a world you don\'t want to visit, it won\'t be featured on a post card, and it\'s said to be the city ignored by god himself. This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, puts you on the edge of your seat -- you are right into the middle of the City and you too are caught up in it\'s violent temptation. More importantly, it\'s about the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.\r\n\r\nThis movie in effect is fast paced and hard to follow (with the added stress of subtitles over Portuguese), but it\'s worth it; and in fact really adds to the impetuous and impulsive undertones of the movie. In addition, the quintessential Brazilian music blending into the film like a well made Caprahina makes it feel authentic like the Italian music in the God Father.\r\n\r\nYou see the flaws of these men played out in an almost fatalistic nature -- hated, greed, futility; and in it all we see ourselves, our own flaws, and our own condition.'),
(68, 'A true classic', '2017-09-20', 2, 68, 'It is always in people\'s nature to put down great things and to nit-pick or sometimes just be plain mean. No matter what anyone says, this is utterly fantastic: in story, in special effects, in casting (with perhaps the sad exception of Leslie Howard as \"Ashley\") and in captivation. Vivien Leigh is so powerful, passionate, magnificent and beautiful that you could watch it 1000 times on that ground alone. She brings something so convincing and human to the role of the selfish, spoilt Scarlett; the character is larger than life.\r\n\r\nLeaving Vivien\'s astounding performance aside, this remains a sweeping unrivalled epic. Watch it. '),
(69, 'Oscar worthy', '2017-09-12', 3, 69, 'Recently the other Dude and I were discussing that not many award worthy movies come out during the summer; then I see The Help. To say it is not a story that I am normally interested in would be an understatement. I wasn\'t around during the time of segregation to fully appreciate the depth of this story. Additionally, if there was ever a movie that screamed \"chick flick\" it would be this one. In spite of that, I\'ve heard wonderful things about the book and decided to view the movie. I\'m happy to say that I\'m glad that I did. Virtually unknown director Tate Taylor put together a cast of relatively unknown actors and actresses that truly made the story go. \r\n\r\nTaylor, whose last movie was the little seen Pretty Ugly People, grabbed a familiar actress to join him in making The Help, Allison Janney. Other than Janney the only other familiar actresses in the movie are Cicely Tyson and Sissy Spacek. The rather unknown cast has a fresh feeling on the story and there are no preconceived notions based on a past actor or actresses work. That being said Emma Stone (Easy A), and Viola Davis had a true coming out party in The Help. Both women played fantastic parts, which really made the cast mesh nicely together. Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain were all spectacular in supporting roles alongside Stone and Davis.\r\n\r\nWhen a movie doesn\'t have the explosions, crazy action or crude humor that we\'ve become accustomed to seeing in newer movies there has got to be a great story attached in order to maintain your interest; The Help had that great story. There aren\'t many movies that have you laughing, crying, or getting angry and end up still being fantastic and that is where this one had me. With my common rule of no movie should be over 2 hours unless it is special; this one is very special. I would be surprised if there aren\'t a number of nominations coming.');
