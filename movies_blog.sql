From start to finish this (just over two hour movie)amazing movie keeps its audience entertained with non stop laughs, tears and overall enjoyment.\r\n\r\nI must admit that since \"I am Sam\" I have never left a movie feeling as happy as I did with Love Actually. It has a good, positive feeling about it which really is the centre of this masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe storylines sound confusing but really they are simple to follow and comprehend. 8 different love stories that interwine and end on an amazing climax on Christmas Eve. \r\n\r\nThe actors, the story, the scenery, the overall spectacle of this brilliant film have definately added it to my top 10 list alongside The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.\r\n\r\nFor a feel good, funny, dramatical masterpiece I strongly recommend it to anyone and everyone.'),
(2, 'She\'s like the wind', '2018-03-04', 2, 2, 'This movie has stood the test of time. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze make movie magic with the sultry dance moves. The choreography and the music make this a ride you will not want to get off of. Now considered a cult classic, it has spawned a television series, Broadway production and most recently a remake (that was horrific). Fantastic piece of celluloid history that ought to be revisited every now and again.'),
(3, 'Heartbreak Mountain!', '2018-02-05', 3, 3, 'For all of those who are holding back from watching this movie because it is \"gay\" or has love scenes between two men...oh! This movie has nothing to do with sex...and to be honest, I don\'t feel that it has much to do with homosexuality. This is the most beautiful and profoundly sad love story I have ever come across, and the fact that it is a love between two men is beside the point. It\'s about a love between two people who cannot be together, but if human beings were better at being human, and if the world was a better place, they would have lived out their lives side by side. I was so, so moved. AMAZING!!!! A must see.'),
(4, 'Pretty good movie', '2018-01-08', 4, 4, 'Wow! Richard Gere and Julia Roberts give magical performances as a shrewd businessman and a lovely prostitute. I was really moved by the blend of humor and romance. The romance was what really moved me. I thought that Edward (Richard Gere) and Vivian (Julia Roberts) looked good in the attire they wore to the opera in San Francisco. Oh, boy, if you ask me, Julia Roberts did, indeed, look like a pretty woman in this movie. PRETTY WOMAN really tugged at my heart and soul and made me laugh at times. Don\'t say I have a twisted sense of humor, but I laughed really hard when Edward yelled at Stuckey (Jason Alexander) to get out of his hotel room. If I ever travel to Beverly Hills, I\'m going to stay at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, that is, if I can afford it. Before I wrap this up, I\'d like to say that I think Richard Gere and Julia Roberts each deserved an Academy Award for their performances. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this star-studded hit to anyone who\'s a fan of Richard Gere or Julia Roberts. You\'ll laugh, you might cry, you\'ll be touched, and you\'ll want to see this box-office smash over and over again.'),
(5, 'I <3 Mr Darcy', '2017-12-18', 1, 5, 'Outstanding ... MacFadyen is a worthy Darcy and a darned good actor to boot! The scenery, backgrounds, and country folk were much more realistic than previous versions. The costumes and hairdos also seemed in keeping with the times. Another great addition is the priceless Donald Sutherland who, in a perfect world, would have had more scenes with Judy Densch. If those two can\'t chew up the scenery, nobody can. And, finally, Keira Knightly is a jewel. Her beauty is so apparent that it almost detracts from the fact that this is a very good actress who can hold her own in any room. This was a delight and I only wish that it could have been 6 hours long.'),
(6, 'Star crossed and starry eyed', '2017-11-07', 2, 6, 'I\'m a sucker for William Shakespeare even though I like it done better in the theatre. This one however, kept my attention and seemed to do a great job with modernizing the whole quarreling families thing. The movie kicks off with a street brawl between the Montegues and Capulets. The Prince forewarns them that if they ever disturb the peace again their \"lives will pay the forfeit of the peace.\" We are then introduced to the character Romeo who is played by Leonardo DeCaprio. Leo does a great job as Romeo, but that\'s because Leo is a good actor in this film. Soon after that we are introduced to Juliet who is played by the beautiful Claire Danes, someone I haven\'t seen in too many movies. Danes does a great job playing the flirty Juliet. The movie follows the original script very accurately. The symbolism is also used very well throughout the movie. If you look at the guns you\'ll notice that some say sword, some say rapier, and I believe some say dagger. The Montegues always wear a Hawaiian style shirt. The Capulets dress more like mobsters or thugs even though both sides could be viewed as thugs in some sort or another. In either case each family wears a certain kind of clothing that makes it easy to tell who\'s who. One great part I absolutely love is the party. Juliet wears angel wings and Romeo wears a knight outfit. Romeo\'s best friend (and I wish I could spell his name but I\'d rather not butcher it) dresses up as a women. So to explain this form of symbolics, for those who aren\'t getting it, it\'s Romeo is the \"knight in shinning armor,\" Juliet is the angel of Romeo\'s dreams, and Romeo\'s best friend is the comic relief. There\'s other things you\'ll notice at the party also, like Tybalt wears devil horns(i.e. he\'s a villain). Both families you\'ll also notice are rich, which also follows the script accurately. Overall, if you\'re a Shakespeare fan, a fan of romantic movies, a fan of tragic movies, or a fan of artistic movies then make sure to look into this one. It\'ll sweep you off you\'re feet, make you laugh, make you cry, and make you fall in love.'),
(7, 'Beastly not beautiful', '2017-10-09', 3, 7, 'The movie from the first scene up to the end was emotionless and spiritless. I do appreciate that they didn\'t want to change the story much and keep the classic version for the most. Even when the movie was slightly tweaked, it was in the wrong dull way. Some tweaks don\'t really make sense and don\'t add up.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know whom should be blamed for the \'emotion delivery failure\' is it the cast or the director? Emma Watson is good actress for some certain roles, but certainly not this one. She was very stiff. We couldn\'t differentiate her surprise from anger or love from sadness. In many scenes Belle and the Beast were talking so fast with no emotions, soul or spirit. It was as if they were rehearsing on a play by reading out loud from their scripts and the director was simply not there.\r\n\r\nCinematography had a problem too. Too many close ups. The original cartoon had some close ups too, but Do they really have to copy everything as-is? The couple dancing scene cinematography could have been better.\r\n\r\nI really don\'t advise anyone to see this movie. Disney failed this time. It happens, though!. Hopefully we\'ll know what really happened.'),
(8, 'Say I\'m a Bird...!', '2017-11-09', 4, 8, 'This amazing love story can be enjoyed by all. The Notebook is not one of those cheesy chick flicks that often come out, it is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to.\r\n\r\nEven most males will agree that this movie pulls at your heart strings. Filled with fabulous quotes, and sentimental moments I found this movie to be one of the best I\'ve seen. I got to know both main characters and found myself relating to each of them. Most of us remember our first love and that strong connection we had with them. This movie makes us think of what could have been and gives us a fresh look at the meaning of true love. I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.'),
(9, 'Richard Curtis at his best', '2017-10-29', 1, 9, 'The effects of personal want, need, love and desire on the friendships of a circle of eclectic individuals is examined with a spot of humor in the witty, clever and oh-so-British comedy of love, romance and finding that special someone, `Four Weddings and a Funeral,\' directed by Mike Newell. Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell head a delightful ensemble cast in this story of a group of long-time friends, all single, who watch and participate over a period of months as one by one those amongst them step up at last to the altar. Of them all, Charles (Grant) seems the most likely-- and at the same time the least likely-- to be next. Young, handsome and charismatic, Charles has no problem developing a relationship (he\'s had a number, in fact, as we learn in one particularly hilarious scene), but sustaining one is seemingly beyond his grasp. Until, at the wedding of one of his friends, he meets Carrie (MacDowell), an American, and she quickly enchants him. It is not the end of the story, however; for Charles, Carrie and the audience, it\'s only-- as they say-- the beginning.'),
(10, 'Lucky me', '2017-11-01', 2, 10, 'I watched this movie on Memorial Day, and was reminded all over again that freedom isn\'t free. So if you are a past or present member of any branch of the US Armed Forces, or if your loved one has paid the ultimate sacrifice with their life, fighting for our freedom, please accept my heartfelt thanks.\r\n\r\nI LOVED this movie. Everyone did an excellent job with their character – especially with Logan. So much feeling and emotion in his expression and actions, even when no words were needed. I felt like I could see into his very soul. I saw a young man who still can hardly grasp the fact that he has survived 3 tours of war in the middle east, when many of his comrades didn\'t come home. You can sense the depth of emotion and turmoil, and can easily understand why it was often hard to just find words to express himself. You can see the military training and discipline, the steel resolve to control his reactions, even when harassed by the town bully/ex-husband. There\'s also loyalty, concern for others, tenderness, selflessness, willingness to work hard – he\'s the man of every woman\'s dream! \r\n\r\nIt\'s easy to see that Beth is a survivor of an extremely abusive marriage. Even though she\'s now divorced, she\'s still not free from the abusive and controlling ex-husband. She\'s very careful in how she responds or endures his abusive threats, in order to keep him from going into a greater rage? and I cheered for her when she finally found the courage to speak up and take control of her own destiny. \r\n\r\nKeith, the ex-husband, is easy to despise, for his hateful, snarly, manipulating character? and yet in the end we saw a little glimpse of good in his soul as well? a little glimpse of what he might have been if he\'d only been willing to humble himself and get help much earlier. \r\n\r\nI loved the happy ending, I loved the story, and I very much appreciated that the producers kept it clean. I can\'t wait for the DVD – this is a keeper!!'),
(11, 'Hot Stuff!', '2018-04-10', 4, 11, 'Hot Fuzz: The story tells us of an over-active \'policeman officer\', Nicholas Angel (Played by the co-star of Shaun of the Dead, Simon Pegg) who is sent to work his duties out in the countryside, to avoid his use of excessive arrests. Suspicions arrive in the town however, as people start getting killed \'accidentally\'. Coupled with his rather unprofessional partner Danny Butterman (Similiarily played by Shaun of the Dead star Nick Frost) they get themselves into suspicious circumstances Nicholas Angel fails to ignore.\r\n\r\nBut what can I say? It\'s just hilarious! An incredibly funny, witty, intelligent British comedy that manages to bring you to tears with laughter and also offers extremely well directed and executed action scenes! If you liked the likes of Shaun of the Dead, you\'ll love this, simple as that. I was oddly surprised to find that it was incredibly violent, albeit, in a cartoony way, but it will definitely make you squint. Plenty of cameo\'s by the likes of the hilarious Bill Bailey and a great cast will make this a action/thriller/comedy hard to forget! Excellent.'),
(12, 'What happens in Vegas...', '2018-02-06', 1, 12, 'I just saw the first screening of the movie, and it is very worth the money you will pay for it. I was skeptical about it at first, thinking that the previews would have only the funny parts, but they are just the tip of the iceberg... Everyone hit a home run in this movie. Even Mike Tyson generated a few laughs for everyone. If you need a pick me up from a bad day, just watch this and you will definitely feel better about everything that may be going wrong in your life. I will DEFINITELY be buying this to watch over and over again once it comes out on DVD, probably even see it in theaters again. I hope you find this review helpful because this movie is definitely a must see in my opinion.');
(13, 'You can\'t sit with us...', '2018-01-28', 3, 13, 'Though my own high school days are well behind me now, this film received enough acclaim that I was convinced to give it a try. Mean Girls did in fact prove to be a rewarding experience. The film made a ton of money and launched some of its young stars into orbit.\r\n\r\nOur story deals with a previously home-schooled girl (Lohan) now having to brave a suburban high school for the first time. She is completely clueless as far as what it takes to be cool in this new world, but she is pretty enough to catch the attention of the most popular girls in the school. The \"Plastics\" as they are called take the young lady into their world and over time she becomes one of them. The more popular the young lady becomes, the more miserable her life becomes, however.\r\n\r\nThe film is very funny and it hits pretty hard with its depictions of the various cliques at modern high schools. Some would argue that the characters in this film are just stereotypes, but so are most real life high schoolers. Nearly everyone fit into one category or another even back in my school days, but things seem even more fragmented now.\r\n\r\nTina Fey has written an intelligent script, and thankfully the film was cast well enough to carry it. Lindsay Lohan is charming, but nothing too exceptional. Rachel McAdams pretty much steals this film, and she is likely the cast member who will have the best career of this bunch. I think it\'s safe to say her scream toward the end of act 2 is the best I\'ve ever heard in any film.Lacey Chabert is also worth mentioning, and she seems worthy of some better roles in the future. Overall, there did not seem to be any casting problems.\r\n\r\nMark Watters keeps things moving along at a brisk pace, and it seems strange to see Lorne Michaels\' name in the credits of any film this funny. From what I\'ve heard, the film had to be trimmed of more than a few parts that would have given it in an R-rating. BOO!!!!!! Hard to argue with the box office totals, though! After watching this film, I was reminded of a similar group of popular girls at my high school. They called themselves the Senior Bitch Patrol, and behaved much the same way as the \"Plastics.\" Only back then (88-91) it was mostly about the hair. The bigger the hair, the more popular the girl. All of these girls have gone on to live boring and pointless lives since those days. Go figure....'),
(14, 'There\'s something in your hair...', '2018-03-04', 4, 14, 'The shock comedy aside (zipper and hair gel scenes), purposeful unpolitically correct moments (humor at expense of handicapped, animal cruelty), the most surprising thing about this film is it has heart and is rather sweet. It\'s not the completely nasty, cruel comedy you might have been expecting. There\'s a nice love story in here too. It\'s corny and cliche\'d and doesn\'t feel overly cloying because there are enough shockingly funny moments to offset it. The acting is good, the pacing brisk, and the jokes, well... you\'ve heard all about the best ones by now.'),
(15, 'Supergood, actually', '2018-04-03', 3, 15, 'Superbad is a teen movie. It also will draw comparisons to American Pie, in it\'s \"losers try to get laid\" themes, and occasional gross-out comedy. But the comparison is unfair - Superbad is a funnier, more subversive and more importantly genuine movie than American Pie or any of it\'s awful sequels were. The three central characters have a believable, likable relationship, that the film takes time to establish. Cera, Hill (who deserves special praise, for turning what could have been a really unlikeable character into a sweet, if loud-mouthed and crass, teenager) and Mintz-Plasse bounce of each other perfectly. The movie creates some funny situations, and more importantly, hilarious dialogue throughout. Aside from one comedic misfire - an overly long (and poorly judged) gross out sight gag involving a pair of trousers and a dance - Superbad had me laughing constantly. It\'s sweet, it\'s funny as hell, and it\'s established a load of new talent.'),
(16, 'An Education in Rock', '2018-02-07', 2, 16, 'Dewey Finn is a lazy freeloader and a guitarist in a rock band who plays gigs every night and sleeps every day, in his friend Ned Schneebly\'s apartment. One day as he shows up late for band practice he notices a new guitar player who is replacing him. Poor Dewey feels so bad about it and also about Ned and his girlfriend threatening to kick him out since he doesn\'t pay any of the bills. After a few days of trying to sell his guitars, which doesn\'t go very well, the head of a school calls and asks for Ned Schneebly, who is a talented substitute teacher with a good reputation. In a desperate attempt to getting money fast, Dewey impersonates Ned and conveniently finds himself the teacher of a third grade ( or something like that ) class for several weeks ahead. Yet another one of his crazy ideas strikes him and his plan to turn his class into a rockband to win the Battle of the Bands competition is set in motion. \r\n\r\nSchool Of Rock is a great feel-good comedy, fun for just about anyone of any age, kids or adults. Jack Black does carry a lot of this film on his own but I won\'t be too harsh on the kids in the movie, they did very well also. If anyone else should play Dewey Finn rather than Jack, it just wouldn\'t be the same. Since Jack is actually in a rock band in real life, and has played a few characters in films before who are also into music, he just seemed to fit right into this film. His real passion for rock music helps a lot in this film, and makes Dewey Finn one hell of a good character. The plot to this film is really good I think and Mike White did a great job on the screenplay. As did Linklater on the direction of the film.\r\n\r\nThis comedy should not be ignored just because there are kids in it, I enjoyed it a hell of a lot and you probably will too. '),
(17, 'Carrey on Jim', '2017-11-07', 1, 17, 'Ace Ventura is the kind of comedy that stems directly from a TV show, and in this case, that show was probably In Living Color, where Carrey got most of his publicity before he became famous as a movie actor. A quick look through Carrey\'s filmography will prove that Ace Ventura is the film that really acted as a springboard for his career. He had a few small roles in films previous to Ace Ventura, the largest of which was probably his role as one of the aliens in the awful film Earth Girls Are Easy, but after Ace Ventura, his career skyrocketed. The Mask (hey, he\'s still new, give the guy a break), Dumb & Dumber, a sequel to Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy (oops), The Truman Show (ah, better), Man On The Moon, Me, Myself & Irene, The Grinch, and there\'s no end in sight.\r\n\r\nSure, Ace Ventura does not compare to half of these movies, and is clearly more on the side of the bone-headed comedy that he was doing on In Living Color, but his talent is unmistakable. I first saw this movie when I was in high school, and I remember that I would ditch school and go to the theater to see it and I would laugh hysterically until my sides hurt every time I saw it. There\'s something about seeing a slob at a tremendously rich party who just doesn\'t care about the etiquette of the rich people. Did anyone not laugh when he was `testing\' the food at Ron Kamp\'s I\'m-the-richest-man-in-the-universe party and stuck his tongue out at that poor guy next to him? That whole scene at that party is classic!\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, it only gets better with Ace\'s dealings with Lois Einhorn. The whole crying game idea may have gone a little too far, but it was always amusing. Jim Carrey saves Ace Ventura from sinking to the totally brainless level of more recent crapfests as the Scary Movies, and even makes this into one of the better comedies of 1994. This is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards, but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and Jim Carrey\'s immediately recognizable rubber-faced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career, which later brought us many more excellent movies. Way to go, Jim.'),
(18, 'Dog eat dog', '2017-12-05', 4, 18, 'Christopher Guest\'s Best of Show follows his great tradition of fake-documentaries which includes This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman. This time, he takes a poke at dog shows, which is something no one has done before (I think). Here, he shows 5 different contenders (including himself which is one of the great parts of this film). Other contenders include Michael McKean, Michael Hitchcock, Catherine O\'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, John Michael Higgins, Parker Posey and in a exceptional effort as a man with 2 left feet, Eugene Levy (he also co-wrote the script with Guest). Often very funny, sometimes poignant, and like all of Guest\'s projects, never dissapointing, only liability might be that it isn\'t for all tastes (but hey, not everyone found 11 on a sound stsyem great either which seems odd).'),
(19, 'Never in doubt', '2018-02-07', 3, 19, 'Many people say that \"Mrs.Doubtfire\" is one of the funniest movies ever made in the U.S. I agree with the above idea for the following two reasons. First,performance of the voice of Robin Williams is very wonderful.For example, he uses a lot of funny ad lib in the stand-in of animation in the first scene. Second, Robin Williams and Sally Field as well as the three children act very delightfully though the movie deals with a rather serious theme---warmth and importance of family. Some people say Sally Field doesn\'t act well in this movie. But, I think that she acts a role of a wife whom is worried about her husband excelentlly. We feel big love of both father and mother toward children. It is not only a real funny comedy but also a real wonderful family movie.'),
(20, 'Vote for Pedro!', '2017-12-04', 1, 20, 'OK, I have seen a lot of negative reviews on this movie. It made me leery of even seeing it. I work at a video store so I get to see movies before their street release date. There were a few naysayers at work, but I rented it anyway. This was a rental well spent. This is the first movie I have seen in some time that doesn\'t have swear words or sex in any form so it is OK for any age. If you are or ever were just a little bit geeky, Napoleon is the hero for you. This movie is much funnier to a gen-x\'er. There are a lot of things that you won\'t \"get\" if you weren\'t a part of the 80\'s. All in all, I think that it is a great way to spend an evening. I am looking forward to seeing more from this writer/director.'),
(21, 'Alien Invasion', '2017-12-01', 3, 21, 'What\'s the fuss about this movie? Why does everyone think so poorly of this? Well, in my opinion they compare this film to the Best Picture movies. This is not a Best Picture film, but a very entertaining popcorn film. This tells the tale of aliens attacking Earth and a group of survivors must unite together to destroy the invading aliens. The acting is decent. Will Smith, with a movie career underway, is excellent. Bill Pullman is great as the President. The effects were amazing especially when the buildings were blown up. David Arnold\'s music score is just fantastic. The theme is still stuck in my head. Overall, this is an excellent film.'),
(22, 'Don\'t be afraid of the dark', '2018-01-02', 3, 22, 'I will admit, I was already a fan of Serenity, Riddick Chronicles and all that, so I did go into this film with a bit of predetermined anticipation. On the flip side, I\'m not always that much of a Vin Deisel fan, in that he is somewhat mono-dimensional in his range of characters, but for the embodiment of Riddick, he does fit perfectly. As for the story and how it plays out, the pace is good, not too encumbered with gratuitous special effects and all that, but where it does fit, the CGI is well done and appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe one really glaring technical defect in this story is how everyone just gets out and starts walking around, breathing in the air without the slightest concern for differences in the atmosphere, microbes and so on, but this is a common flaw that is often somehow glossed over in many such stories, so I can\'t harp on that detail too much.\r\n\r\nAs for Radha Mitchell, she is smokin\' hot here, not in a ridiculous or frivolous way, but as her tough, seasoned interplanetary merchant marine ship\'s captain character \"Fry\", she nails it perfectly. If anything, she very much reminds me of Andrea Osvart (see her as the Hungarian assassin \"Gilda\" in the film \"Two Tigers\").'),
(23, 'A gigantic family film', '2017-12-06', 3, 23, 'All too often, \"family films\" are only infantile, simplistic formulas with a few self-referential and pop-culture jokes thrown in to try and keep adults awake. But then along comes something like \"The Iron Giant\", which is sophisticated enough to demand respect while maintaining a mythic and pure-hearted tone that actually does appeal to the kid in everybody.\r\n\r\n\"The Iron Giant\" is refreshingly non-Disney in no end of ways. Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story, instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula. The animation definitely has its eye-popping moments, but there are also scenes of great wonderment, pathos, and humour that only top-drawer animation can convey. The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney). No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the \"world\" of the movie, or to advance the plot. At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again.\r\n\r\n\"The Iron Giant\" is funny, exhilarating, and touching as well. It\'s sad to see it failing at the box office, as a blunt reminder that the success of films is often in direct proportion to their publicity budget. Hopefully, though, word-of-mouth will come to its rescue. Go see it! Tell your friends! Then go again! (Repeat as necessary.)'),

What JJ Abrams has done is create a film that can be enjoyed by all, its irrelevant whether or not you have seen Star Trek before, this film stands alone as brilliant entertainment. There are plenty of references to the original series to keep the fans happy. Of course there are going to be the \"hard core\" fans who will criticize certain aspects. I enjoyed seeing the lead actors imitate the characteristics of the original crew, Karl Urban as Dr Mcoy was particularly good. Good story line, plenty of humour, non-stop fast action, fantastic special effects, great acting from all the main \"crew\", Zacchary Quinto and Chris Pine especially. Can\'t wait for the next one to see more in-depth character development (of all the characters, not just Kirk and Spock and a moral dilemma which is at the heart of the best Star Trek.

When completed, it will spell certain doom for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the Rebels. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is a prisoner of crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) soon finds herself in the gangster\'s hands. Luke Skywalker, aided by C-3PO and R2-D2, makes his way into Jabba\'s palace, hoping to secure his friends\' freedom. But the Hutt has no intention of doing so and tries to kill them all. After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the Rebel fleet, which is massing for an attack against the new satellite battle station at Endor. Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is pressed into action to lead the Rebel fighter attack, while Han is put in charge of a group of soldiers to take out the shield generator protecting the Death Star. Luke, however, surrenders to Vader\'s soldiers on Endor, and is taken in front of Vader\'s boss - the Galactic Emperor - on the Death Star for final corruption to the Dark Side of the Force. The fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers ambushes the Rebels, cutting them off. Worse, the new Death Star begins turning its giant laser on the Rebel carriers. It appears that nothing will stop the Empire\'s triumph - unless things start to change quickly.'),
(27, 'The man in the iron suit', '2017-12-04', 1, 27, 'When it comes to ranking the Marvel superhero(live action) films, Iron Man is for me up there with the better ones. It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man\'s suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn\'t go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I\'ve always considered one of Marvel\'s most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic\'s 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn\'t do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr\'s performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don\'t come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn\'t quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own.'),
(28, 'To gravity and beyond', '2018-04-01', 2, 28, 'This is a break through kind of film. Cuaron crossed boundaries and he didn\'t have the technology to do it, he create it. Just like genius do. It has been a really long time since you could go to a see a movie and experience this kind of translated emotions as vividly and organically and in so many different levels And will be some time for the next one. For the story, you can go as deep as YOU like, and in as many different approaches as each person who watch it. You choose. ..Cuaron guide us into an amazing out of this earth journey. And knowing all the things he had to achieve to do it it\'s just amazing. Amazing Bullock..Best film ever. Can\'t imagine anybody else for it. Great with Clooney ( wondering why they never worked together before) Can\'t wait for everybody have the opportunity to watch it, and share the experience!'),
(29, 'Dark times for Donnie', '2017-12-18', 3, 29, 'In the end, _Donnie Darko_ is a film about people who feel life and all the emotions within it very deeply. Donnie himself is a basically sweet-tempered (often courageous) young man who is pathologically terrified of loneliness and the thought of spiritual isolation. His quest for meaning and self-discovery drives him to the fringes of our reality, which only serves to isolate him more from the world he loves. The few who understand what Donnie is going through go largely unnoticed (such as his girlfriend Gretchen or a tragically overweight yet remarkable sensitive little girl) or unappreciated (such as Karen, the English teacher whose only sin is trying to show her students that there is no such thing as a true end.)\r\n\r\nOf course, this movie far from polarizes its characters (indeed, polarization is the last thing this film wants to accomplish) and the majority are just a mishmash of the beautiful and the grotesque: Donnie\'s parents, who are at the same time loving and perpetually confused; the aforementioned self-helper Jim Cunningham, who is desperate to spread the lie that keeps him sane to everybody else; and Donnie\'s sister, struggling between her identity as an adult and her identity as a child. And then there\'s Frank. All I can say here is that nothing can prepare you for or adequately describe Frank.\r\n\r\nProbably the best thing about this movie, though, is its incredible emotional range. It manages to inspire hope, love, dread, laughter, and tears at different points throughout the movie without making you feel least bit like there is a contradiction between those states. The scenes with Frank (especially the one that takes place in the therapist\'s office against the backdrop of a conversation about the end of the world) are quite frankly some of the scariest things I\'ve ever seen in a movie, as they literally made my skin crawl.\r\n\r\nFinally, the performances in this film are exquisite. The talent in this film is top notch and even Gyllenhall is just amazing. That said, though, this film has a dismal future. Combine the fact that the large majority of the moviegoing public is just going to find it unbearably weird with the fact that the movie begins with part of an airplane crashing into a building (this has got to be the very definition of bad timing) and it\'s pretty clear that this film is going to stay underground. However, if you are looking for a beautiful experience with a unique film, _Donnie Darko_ is just about as good as it gets.'),
(30, 'He\'ll be back', '2018-02-05', 2, 30, 'First of all, if you haven\'t seen this action, suspense and violence extravaganza, you most certainly are not a true action movie afficionado. The immediate grabbing feature of this movie is its score, very imaginatively composed and created by Alan Silvestri whose other credits include the Back to the Future series and other gems like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The tempo and build up which the score lends to the film engage its viewers with feelings of fear and nerve wracking suspense for what lurks within the thick of the forest. Take note of Sonny Landham\'s comment;\"there\'s something out there,and it ain\'t no man.\r\n\r\nThe action is fast, furious and merciless. The commandos are killed off one by one, leaving Arnie, Carl Weathers and the surviving members extremely terrified and on the verge of breaking down. Note the heated arguments that some of the commandos get into with each other. There is very animated and fiery action in the beginning (assault on the terrorist camp) but as we are introduced to the true terror of the jungle (or should I say, outer space), the action takes a turn for the more insane eg.Arnie running away armed only with a knife and trembling in fear, almost drowning in a waterfall and thereafter, continually pursued by the Predator). All this followed by a half hour long jungle battle mano a mano with spears, rocks and fists and hall deafening yells by both warriors. Very, very fierce and macho stuff I assure you all.\r\n\r\nI shall not go into the other intricacies of the film and will leave it to the curiosity of potential/virgin viewers to find out for themselves. \"Predator\" is essentially one of the few action movies that truly lives up to its name and delivers the thrills and spills in no small amount and at breakneck speed. True connoisseurs of hard action.....'),
(31, 'Horrifically Good', '2017-12-01', 1, 31, 'While \"The Babadook\" may display some of the hallmarks of the traditional horror film, there\'s a lot more going on here than meets the eye. Far from the typical Hollywood bloodfest so brilliantly satired in \"Cabin in the Woods,\" this film\'s characters are layered, its plot is mercurial, its actions are metaphorical, and its conclusions are ambiguous. All this is likely to disappoint those filmgoers who need to be spoonfed a formula. But if you\'re a film lover, Do. Not. Miss. This.\r\n\r\nDirector Jennifer Kent understands what most horror filmmakers fail to grasp: that our biggest fear isn\'t of crazy killers or monsters or ghosts, but of ourselves—what lives inside us, the emotions we have to live with, the illusory veil of self-control. \r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around a mum, her troubled son and the book he pulls off the shelf one night. But you already know too much. This is one film where knowing less going into it will really pay dividends. Really, don\'t even watch the trailer.\r\n\r\nJust know that the storytelling and craft are flawless. Essie Davis delivers one of the most challenging performances put to screen with total commitment and credibility. Kent\'s storytelling is utterly absorbing and she so delicately treads the line between what\'s real and what\'s not that you can never be sure of yourself. \r\n\r\nWhat you make of \"The Babadook\" will depend on who you are. You might take it at face value, as a creepy monster flick with all the constant threat and looming dread and shocking moments. You might take it as an attempt to capture the authentic experience of mental illness. You might take it as a symbolic story using a metaphor for grief and loss. The best films make you feel something and allow you the room to make sense of it yourself.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I thought about this film for days after seeing it, both because of its ambiguity and because of the themes it explores, namely mental illness and domestic violence. Yes, it\'s scary. But it\'s also touching and heartbreaking. While \"The Babadook\" belongs alongside other great psychological horror films, like \"The Innocents\" and \"The Haunting\" (1963), to classify it purely as \"horror\" really belittles its accomplishment as a film that challenges us to examine and discuss issues we are very uncomfortable tackling in reality.'),
(32, 'Mist-erious', '2018-04-09', 3, 32, 'Thomas Jane (leading male and well known from The Punisher) has a brilliant and emotional portrayal of his character in a mind-blowing situation that we feel intimately associated with thanks to his acting and great directing. Laurie Holden (of X-Files and Silent Hill fame) has a more subdued performance but plays her role well and for any X-Files nut (such as myself) it\'s fun to see her in another movie. The cast is chock full of well known actors and some unknowns that really see and express the writer and directors vision. It pays off: They succeed in pulling you into a traumatic situation made worse with a mixture of religious zealotry, military conspiracy, and small-town ignorance that explodes in your face wondering if your humanity is worse off facing The Mist or the human condition.\r\n\r\nThere is no spoiler here but I will say this about the ending: It\'s what makes the movie and makes it so much better than most of the crap put out there in horror land. Yes, yes, getting cut in half and having limbs ripped-off is horrible. However it is the decisions we have to make that concern those we love and respect that can really drive one mad. The ending makes you look at yourself and wonder, if given the same situation, what you would have to do with the information you have available. It makes you think hard about your humanity and your soul and about what is right or wrong in any given situation involving our mortality.\r\n\r\nI would suggest this movie to anyone that likes horror or science fiction and wants something a little more intense than, say, Army of Darkness (one of my personal favorites for totally different reasons). This movie deals with serious issues we hear about daily. The mist is just a piece of Science Fiction thrown in to bring out the best...and worst in us.'),
(33, 'I always feel like somebody\'s watching me...', '2017-12-17', 4, 33, 'Inspired by 70\'s and 80\'s horror, it follows is a refreshing psychological horror film with a simple premise and a chilling concept. The cinematography is electrifying, every shot is beautiful and the score holds brilliance, it carries a very obvious John Carpenter vibe to it. The tension is raw, avoiding cheap jump scares and relies on music. Its eerie atmosphere is extremely effective keeping you inches above your seat for the majority of the runtime. The characters are interesting, providing depth and emotional attachment, most modern horror films seem to forget the importance of character development, its nice to see the genre hasn\'t completely lost it yet. There are several jumps scares, but they work, as they are not carried with unnecessary piecing music jolts but with the use of disturbing and sudden imagery.\r\n\r\nThe only errors I could detect were the unconventional editing style, the transitions were a little dodgy lacking fluency, this left the film to appear choppy at times but this flaw can be easily forgiven. Its outstanding cinematography and soundtrack make up for this. The film leaves a daunting stain of disturbing after effects that follow you for a long while, with a constant reminder to always check behind your back. An exceptional low budget indie horror film, strongly recommend.'),
(34, 'El orfanato', '2017-10-11', 3, 34, 'The former orphan Laura (Belén Rueda) raises her adopted son Simón (Roger Príncep) with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) in an old house and former orphanage where she was raised. Simón is HIV positive and tells Laura that he has five invisible friends, and she believes they are fruit of his imagination. Laura decides to reopen an orphanage for handicapped children in the location and during the opening party, Simón calls her to show the little cabin of his friend Tomás. The busy Laura does not gives much attention to her son; then she sees a mysterious masked boy and Simón vanishes. Laura feels the presence of other persons in the house and months later, the desperate Laura invites a team of parapsychologists to try to unravel the mystery.\r\n\r\n\"El Orfanato\" is a creepy and spooky ghost story with a dark and very sad atmosphere. The screenplay, direction, acting and cinematography are great, disclosing a dramatic and sensitive plot that explores the disappearance of a young boy with touches of supernatural in the despair of his mother. However, the explanation of the mystery in the end makes this sensitive movie actually a drama, and not horror genre, and maybe that is the reason why some viewers have written bad reviews (or maybe they have not understood the plot).'),
(35, 'I\'m never going to Australia after watching this!', '2017-09-29', 4, 35, 'In the genre, decades ago, the original movie was well made. For this TV series remake, I launched first episode last night and stopped after brief viewing. Rare for me to do so. Why?\r\n\r\n1. acting is very poor; below B series. 2. within the beautiful dry Australian landscape, action moves directly into some lush tropical environment. No connection between the two. 3. the kids jumps into the pond as if the travelers had never heard of salt crocodiles in Australian Northern Territory\'s water bodies. Crocodile attack was laughable. 4. The fight between daughter and father was very poorly scripted and played.'),
(36, 'Gory but gorgeous', '2017-12-20', 4, 36, 'I\'m so happy that I watched this brilliant gem of a horror movie two days ago.In those politically correct times where idiotic MTV-oriented teen slashers and comedies are made in the US,it is really good to see such original film like \"Ginger Snaps\".Why?Because it has some excellent suspense sequences and a rather high amount of blood and gore.The werewolf is really cool looking,the acting by two lead girls(Emily Perkins,Katharine Isabelle)is excellent and the direction is well-handled.\"Ginger Snaps\" is a pure horror film,that is to be taken seriously.I think it ranks up there with Daniel Attias \"Silver Bullet\" and Joe Dante\'s \"The Howling\"'),
(37, 'Cillian Murphy... 28 years before Peaky Blinders', '2018-01-09', 2, 37, 'I\'m amazed there are so many negative reviews of this film; I thought it succeeded on every level. It\'s artistic and atmospheric, with a great pace, sympathetic characters, and a fantastic climax. The music is very nicely done, and, to me, the eerie opening scenes of the empty London streets are worth the price of admission all on their own. I\'m a stubborn viewer, and, normally, when a film benefits from early critical buzz in the manner that this one did, I find some excuse not to like it. But not this time; I\'m completely impressed. (Incidentally, I think it\'s interesting that while most horror films these days seem to have been inspired by knockoffs of knockoffs, \"28 Days Later\" apparently owes more to John Wyndham\'s classic disaster novel \"The Day of the Triffids\" than to anything else. And that\'s a good thing.) HIGHLY recommended.'),
(39, 'The Descent is decent', '2018-02-02', 4, 39, 'I loved it, I went in expecting something along the lines of \"Dog soldiers\", something funny and enjoyable but instead I got a roller coaster ride of tension and fear. So often these days horror movies just aren\'t scary, they make you jump they have a little bit of atmosphere and that\'s it, well this film was scary. It was tense, well acted, and the director made great use of the setting to scare the hell out of you. I don\'t want to go in to a lot of detail in this review, as I don\'t want to spoil the experience for anyone who reads it, and that is what this film is an experience I came out of the cinema shaking. This film is well worth your time.'),

I was there, in that boat, in that gloomy cabin, with those people - everything seemed so real (and alas, the sea never looked the same again). When I watch it these days I still marvel: the atmosphere and the performances in this film are simply magical. Spielberg without the schmalz. He has never been better.');

I loved Jason Bourne; but where Bourne is confused for half the movie, Neeson is looking down a barrel of a pistol 3/4 of the time. In a three way spy battle, I would put Neeson edging out Bourne, who would be a step ahead of Bond.\r\n\r\nBetween the jaw-dropping action sequences was the subject matter of international trafficking, which was pretty miserable to watch.
